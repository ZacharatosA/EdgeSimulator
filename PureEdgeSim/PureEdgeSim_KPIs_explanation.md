| KPI | Explanation |
|-----|-------------|
| **Task Execution Metrics** | |
| Total tasks execution time | The total time spent executing all tasks (in seconds) |
| Average task execution time | The average time taken to execute a single task (in seconds) |
| Total waiting time | The total time tasks spent waiting before execution started (in seconds) |
| Average task waiting time | The average time each task spent waiting before execution (in seconds) |
| Tasks successfully executed | Percentage of tasks that were successfully executed out of all sent tasks |
| **Task Failure Metrics** | |
| Not executed due to resource unavailability | Percentage of tasks that failed because there were no resources available |
| Executed but failed due to high delay | Percentage of tasks that were executed but failed because they took too long |
